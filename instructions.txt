Git Notes

Git manages a local database to manage files being staged and committed, pulled and psuhed and added etc.

git config --global user.name "tkkathiravan"

git config --global user.mail "tkkathiravan@gmail.com"

git config --edit --global = opens the editor file

git config --global core.editor "code --wait --new-window"  = set git to use Visual studio as code as defaut. [add c:\program files\visual studio code\bin as path in the env variables of the system config.]

3 Iprtant stages of Git

Committed - the data is bascally stored in local DB.
Modified - modified but not committed to the local DB yet.
Staged - the modified file is staged to be committed to the DB.

3 Areas of git

Working Directory - Local files created, edited and deleted.
staging Area - Changes from the local worign dir is staged before committed.
.git Repo - before committed it will be kept in the local repository.  created and managed by git itself.
Remote repository GITHUB. - remote is the central repository

git config - configuring the git command
git init - initialize a git repository
git clone - download a project from remote to local directory. creates a remote tracking branch
gti add - add single or multiple files to staging

 ssh -T git@github.com 
 
  
 Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.  - ORIGIN is Remote

 this cmd below will download the fodler to local repository. 
git clone repolink [ex: if HTTPS: https://github.com/tkkathiravan/PS.git] [IF: SSh: git@github.com:tkkathiravan/PS.git]

git push origin master -- from the same local repository folder will push the content to the same folder in remote.

Git fetch -- will peek into the remot repo to see what files are modified and download the changes to the git local Databse. but it didnt updates to the local repo folder.
