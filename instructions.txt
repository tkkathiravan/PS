Git Notes

Git manages a local database to manage files being staged and committed, pulled and psuhed and added etc.

git config --global user.name "tkkathiravan"

git config --global user.mail "tkkathiravan@gmail.com"

git config --edit --global = opens the editor file

git config --global core.editor "code --wait --new-window"  = set git to use Visual studio as code as defaut. [add c:\program files\visual studio code\bin as path in the env variables of the system config.]

3 Iprtant stages of Git

Committed - the data is bascally stored in local DB.
Modified - modified but not committed to the local DB yet.
Staged - the modified file is staged to be committed to the DB.

3 Areas of git

Working Directory - Local files created, edited and deleted.
staging Area - Changes from the local worign dir is staged before committed.
.git Repo - before committed it will be kept in the local repository.  created and managed by git itself.
Remote repository GITHUB. - remote is the central repository


Commands 
git - all cmd starts with git 
git config - configuring the git command
git init - initialize a git repository
git clone - download a project from remote to local directory. creates a remote tracking branch
gti add - add single or multiple files to staging
git commit -  commit file to repository
git status - gives status of the git repository
reademe.md - md = mock down file type
git log - shows the log of whats happening
git add . adds all the fies from the current directory
git commit -am [-a - all files and -m is adding a message]

Create a ssh key to connect ot github using ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "tkkathiravan.gmail.com"

Check status of ssh agent
 eval $(ssh-agent -s)
 
 Add the ssh key to the agent 
 ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa 
 
 Add the contents of the id_rsa key to the setting ssh key in Github
 Test conection to github using SSH
 ssh -T git@github.com 
 
  
 Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.  - ORIGIN is Remote

 this cmd below will download the fodler to local repository. 
git clone repolink [ex: if HTTPS: https://github.com/tkkathiravan/PS.git] [IF: SSh: git@github.com:tkkathiravan/PS.git]

git push origin master -- from the same local repository folder will push the content to the same folder in remote.

Git fetch -- will peek into the remot repo to see what files are modified and download the changes to the git local Databse. but it didnt updates to the local repo folder.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
in the last example, we made two changes one online and another locally. -- when tried to push the change from loca to reote, remote didnt accepept the chnage as ther was a change ther ein remote, so as ot overcome this, we pulled the chnages from the remote first. [ we should be using git fetch and manual merge if there are conflicts.]
once the remote change is added locally - we can then use git push to upload our local changes to remote.  this will merge both chnages in the remote repo.
